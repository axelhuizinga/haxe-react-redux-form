# Haxe React Redux Form

A Haxe library offering externs for the [React Redux Form](https://github.com/davidkpiano/react-redux-form) library.

React Redux Form is a collection of reducer creators and action creators that make implementing even the most complex and custom forms with React and Redux simple and performant.

## HRRF 0.1.0: Focus on local forms

The first release of this library will only focus on local forms, and will leave out the following APIs: `modelReducer`, `formReducer`, `combineForms`, `createForms` and action creators.

The plan it to make it work seamlessly with `haxe-redux`, which may not be the case out of the box.

### 0.1.0 roadmap

 * [X] `Control.x` components
 * [X] `Form` component
 * [X] `LocalForm` component
 * [X] `Errors` component
 * [X] `Fieldset` component
 * [X] `Field` component
 * [ ] Example app for local forms
