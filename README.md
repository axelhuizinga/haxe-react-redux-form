# Haxe React Redux Form

A Haxe library offering externs for the [React Redux Form](https://github.com/davidkpiano/react-redux-form) library.

React Redux Form is a collection of reducer creators and action creators that make implementing even the most complex and custom forms with React and Redux simple and performant.

## HRRF 0.1.x: Focus on local forms

The first release of this library focuses on local forms, and leaves out the following APIs: `modelReducer`, `formReducer`, `combineForms`, `createForms` and action creators.

The plan it to make it work seamlessly with `haxe-redux`, which may not be the case out of the box.
